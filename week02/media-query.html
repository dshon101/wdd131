            <h2>2 Nephi 4:26</h2>
            <p>O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so
            much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my
            strength slacken, because of mine afflictions?</p>

            <p>And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all
            that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had
            ever seen.</p>
