                <p>Hi, my name is Demetrious Shoniwa, and my career objective is to become a cybersecurity specialist. Iâ€™m currently studying
                cybersecurity and network defense, which is equipping me with the skills to protect systems, detect threats, and defend
                networks from cyberattacks. I have a strong passion for helping people and a growing talent in coding, which allows me
                to create secure solutions and assist others in understanding complex tech issues. My goal is to work in an environment
                where I can continuously learn, contribute to digital safety, and make a real difference in protecting people and
                organizations online.</p>

                <p>Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in Southeast Africa, situated between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It shares borders
                with South Africa to the south and Botswana to the southwest. This geographical positioning influences its climate,
                resources, and regional relationships. The country's location has historically played a significant role in its trade
                and interactions with neighboring nations. Its position also makes it crucial to the region's transit routes.</p>
